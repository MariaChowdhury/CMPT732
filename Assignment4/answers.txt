1. How much of a difference did the .cache() make in your Reddit ETL code?
For reddit-3 dataset,
Without cache: real    0m44.430s
With cache: real   0m34.032s

2.When would .cache() make code slower than without?
Unnecessary use of cache can make the code slower.
For example, in my code I used .cache() for storing the filtered data for later processing and processing more than once.
But if I used .cache() when loading the data, it would make the code slower unnecessarily.

3.Under what conditions will the broadcast join be faster than an actual join?
Once a value is broadcasted, then it is sent to each executor. Any function can access the .value property of it. As a result broadcast join are faster than an actual join

4.When will the broadcast join be slower?
When we broadcast large amount of data then all the executors will be overloaded and making the system slower instead of faster.
